# Kapablo theme

The kapablo (Esperanto for capacity) theme is the default theme for the
capacity4more project.



## Installation

The theme is created using sass, svg icons, â€¦

The css is not included in this folder. You need to build it from within the
build folders:

```
$ cd <root of the project>/build/themes/kapablo
$ bundle install
$ npm install
$ grunt build
```


## Development

Changing the styling is done by changing the sass/* files within the theme
folder.

You can Grunt watch for changes and auto rebuild the files:

```
$ cd <root of the project>/build/themes/kapablo
$ grunt watch
```
